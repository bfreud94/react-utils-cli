# React CLI Utils
This project is mainly for creating React TypeScript components, styles, and types files on the fly, but might be used for other things in the future.

# Installation
This package is meant to be setup as a global utility, rather than something part of an individual project that bulks up the local node_modules

```
npm i -g react-utils-cli
```

# Example Usage
```
react-utils --reactTSComponent=TestComponent --styles --types --fileLocation=src/path/to/component
```
